For instance, in the sentence `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`, the names in this sentence are the most important tokens for predicting that the final token will be `\"Mary\"`, and this is because of the particular context of this sentence rather than the tokens' position.\n",

In other words, to get the logit score for a particular token at some sequence position, we just take the vector in the residual stream at that sequence position and take the inner product with the corresponding token embedding vector. This is more training-efficient (because there are fewer parameters in our model), and it might seem pricipled at first. After all, if two words have very similar meanings, shouldn't they have similar embedding vectors because the model will treat them the same, and similar unembedding vectors because they could both be substituted for each other in most output?\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this is actually not very principled, for the following main reason: **the direct path involving the embedding and unembedding should approximate bigram frequencies**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break down this claim. **Bigram frequencies** refers to the frequencies of pairs of words in the english language (e.g. the bigram frequency of \"Barack Obama\" is much higher than the product of the individual frequencies of the words \"Barack\" and \"Obama\"). If our model had no attention heads or MLP layers, then all we have is a linear map from our one-hot encoded token `T` to a probability distribution over the token following `T`. This map is represented by the linear transformation $t \\to t^T W_E W_U$ (where $t$ is our one-hot encoded token vector). Since the output of this transformation can only be a function of the token `T` (and no earlier tokens), the best we can do is have this map approximate the true frequency of bigrams starting with `T`, which appear in the training data. Importantly, **this is not a symmetric map**. We want `T = \"Barack\"` to result in a high probability of the next token being `\"Obama\"`, but not the other way around!\n",
        "\n",
        "Even in multi-layer models, a similar principle applies. There will be more paths through the model than just the \"direct path\" $W_E W_U$, but because of the residual connections there will always exist a direct path, so there will always be some incentive for $W_E W_U$ to approximate bigram frequencies.\n",
